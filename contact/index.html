### Our lab is on the second floor of the Biomedical Sciences and Physics Building at UC Merced.


### UC Merced can be reached:  
* #### by car:
  * Detailed directions to campus can be found [here](https://www.ucmerced.edu/maps-and-directions).
  * For visitors who drive to campus, UC Merced has [parking spaces](https://taps.ucmerced.edu/map) available. [Visitor permits](https://taps.ucmerced.edu/permits/visitorsvendors) are for temporary parking in any non-specially marked space in the Bellevue lot. 
* #### by public transit:
  * From downtown Merced, you can take the "The Bus" along the [UC Merced Route](https://mercedthebus.com/220/UC---UC-Merced) to campus, or ride one of the UC Merced [CatTracks]() shuttles.
* #### from out of town:
  * If you are visiting us from out of town and need to fly, there are several options. 
  * The Merced Regional Airport [(MCE)](https://www.flymercedairport.com/) is closest, but has the most limited flights. There are also airports in Fresno [(FAT)](https://flyfresno.com/) and Stockton [(SCK)](https://flystockton.com/), which are both about one hour away by car. Additionally, for some travelers, it might be best to fly to San Francisco [(SFO)](https://www.flysfo.com/) or Sacramento [(SMF)](https://sacramento.aero/smf), which are each about two hours away by car.
  * If you like to travel by rail, there is an [Amtrak](https://www.amtrak.com/content/amtrak/en-us/stations/mcd.html) station in Merced.


### Once on campus, proceed to the Biomedical Sciences and Physics building.
* The building is new and may not appear on mapping applications quite yet, but you can use the GPS coordinates in the map above to help guide you. -->
