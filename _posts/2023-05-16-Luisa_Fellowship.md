We are so happy and proud to announce that Luisa from our lab has received the Miguel Velez Scholarship for her research for the upcoming Fall and Spring semesters. Luisa is thrilled that she can focus more on her research on temperature-sensing kinases thanks to this support. We wish her the best.
