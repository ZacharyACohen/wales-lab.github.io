This Friday in the UC Merced Commencement ceremony, Thompson lab had three undergrads graduating. Andree, Dondis, and Vincent all graduated and went on with the rest of their academic journey. Vincent is going to Stanford to pursue his grad studies, Dondis will continue her studies at UCSF, and Andree will stay with us to complete her research as an assistant researcher in the Thompson lab. We're so proud of all of them.
