Our lab's Halloween party this year was so spooky! Held at Mike's place, the party brought together the Thompsons, the Sukeniks and the Liwangs for a spooktacular night of fun. Shahar's adorable baby girls presented the "best costume award" to Zahra from Pati Liwang's lab. Eduardo and David from the Sukenik's lab and Alec had a marvelous Halloween-special rock music performance with a special appearance by the talented guitarist, Dr. Shahar Sukenik.
