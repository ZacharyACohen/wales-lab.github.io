Behnoush, Josh, and Nat presented a collaborative talk on "methods to characterize the structure and folding of a designed protein" in the CCBM Thrust 1 meeting this week.  Their talks were respectively focused on protein engineering, X-ray crystallography, and enzyme kinetics. It was a nice presentation and an instructive experience for them.
