Alexander presented at the CBC department's weekly seminars this week. He gave a great summary of the research that he has been doing on the chaperone TRAP1 proteins. He will conclude this project in a manuscript soon and will continue his work on CDK2 proteins, and their effect on the cell cycle after this.
