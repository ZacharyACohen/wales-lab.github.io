This summer, we have three talented interns assisting us with our research. Andree is focusing on CDK2 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 2) as a BioXFEL scholar. Asini is our other BioXFEL scholar collaborating with Behnoush on BH32.14, a designed protein for catalyzing the Morita-Bayliss-Hillman reaction. Gyssele is working alongside Luisa on temperature-sensing kinases. We're delighted to have them all on board for a productive summer of research!
