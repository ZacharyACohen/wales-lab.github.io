Guisel presented the research that she did with our lab this summer through a poster presentation at the BioXFEL end of the summer program poster presentation held at the UC Merced Conference center. We were so happy to have her with us this summer. She collaborated with Luisa on CLK kinases, and made a lot of progress in the project.
